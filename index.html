                    <p>&mdash; Hi boys and girls! I love to be at one with nature. Therefore, I travel my whole life. I am like a wandering warrior who gets better and better in martial arts every day, I have no time to rest. Workouts, workouts and more workouts! The only this way!
                      Many people say that I have a bad sense of humor, but this is not at all true, it's just that they are stupid ape-like people and do not understand the pinnacle of true humor.
                      I'm also a fan of Captain America, Spider-Man and Cyclops. He-he =)</p>

                    <p><em>Early childhood</em></p>
                    <p>As a child, Ryu became an orphan and was left without memories of his parents and whether or not they were alive. He was adopted by a man named Goken, who raised Ryu in his secluded dojo and began training Ryu along the path of his martial arts.
                      When Ryu was 23 years old, Goken felt that Ryu was willing to travel the world in order to test and hone his fighting prowess against the best fighters from around the world.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><em>24 years old</em></p>
                    <p>Ryu is one of the participants in the first Street Fighter tournament. After defeating the rivals, Ryu got the right to fight the host of the tournament, Sagat. Sagat nearly defeats Ryu and, thinking he has won, drops his guard to help Ryu rise. Ryu, however, had such a strong desire to win that it allowed him to be gripped by Satsui no Hado, after which he struck Sagata with an almost fatal metsu-shoryuken, eventually not only leaving Sagata unconscious, but also inflicting a large scar on him. penetrating the entire chest. After Sagat came to his senses and called what happened, he vowed to take revenge on Ryu.</p>

                    <p><em>27 years old</em></p>
                    <p>Ryu enters the tournament "Street Fighter ll" to test his abilities and defeats many new fighters. It is unknown how far Ryu went in this tournament.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p><em>29 years old</em></p>
                    <p>Sometime after the second tournament, Ryu entered a new tournament to further improve his skills, as well as meet his longtime friend Ken in a rematch. During his trip, he met Sakura, whom he recommends to train further. Meanwhile, Ryu also meets with former rival Sagat, who reminds him of the promised rematch. During the final fight with Seth, he defeats him at S.I.N. After this battle, the building fell around them, as Ryu used Satsui no Hado on the BLECE machine, a weapon of mass destruction developed by S.I.N. that harnesses energy in the human body; Sakura comes to his aid and they leave the building together, the weapon destroyed. He also learns that Goken actually survived his last fight with Akuma, and they fight in a sparring match in which Goken wins. During the skirmish, Goken isolates the remnants of Satsui no Hado within Ryu, causing Akuma's dream of Ryu's combat strength in this aspect to be shattered.</p>
